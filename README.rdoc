The official home for the Chore App!

The project has officially begun.

About the Project

The idea was birthed in February 2016, when Elijah came down to visit us. He was interested in completing a programming project with us, but between trips to the zoo and the Everglades, there wasn't nearly enough time. 

This time, however, we were prepared. As soon as he arrived, we selected a few days to work on a project together. A single project was selected: a chore app, which would contain user profiles, lists of chores, a reward system, etc. 

That day, we divided up the work and began the research and development process. Our research was focused on four main sections:

	• Chore Research - What type of chores are out there?
    
	• Existing Apps - Are there any chore apps already? What are they like? What are their strengths? Weaknesses?
    
	• Similar Apps - What about similar apps, like fitness apps, etc? What can we learn from their gamification systems?
    
	• Platform Research - What are we going to build this application on? Is it going to be web based? What platform is the best for this kind of application?
